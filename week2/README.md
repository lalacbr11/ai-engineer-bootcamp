# Week 2

## Day 2 – Python Essentials
- Practiced variables, data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Worked with strings (slicing, `.lower()`)
- Built lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Challenge: I struggled a little with **tuples** and **dictionaries**, but reviewing examples helped me understand them better.

## Day 3 – Control Flow
- Learned `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- Practiced `for` loops (iterating over ranges and lists)
- Practiced `while` loops
- Explored `break` and `continue`
- Challenge: My first attempts had syntax mistakes with comparison operators and string formatting inside loops. Fixed by carefully checking the syntax.

📝 **Notes to myself:**  
- Always test small code snippets in Jupyter before adding more complexity.  
- Remember: `elif grade >= 80` not `=>`.  
- Print formatting is easier using `f"..."`.
