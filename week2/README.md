# Week 2

## Day 1 – Review & Setup
- Reviewed Python basics and Jupyter setup
- Practiced writing simple print statements
- Checked how to run code cells in Jupyter
- Learned the difference between Markdown cells and Code cells
- Challenge: Remembering to **run the cell (Shift+Enter)** before moving on — sometimes my errors came from not running updated code.

## Day 2 – Python Essentials
- Practiced variables, data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Worked with strings (slicing, `.lower()`)
- Built lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Challenge: I struggled a little with **tuples** and **dictionaries**, but reviewing examples helped me understand them better.

## Day 3 – Control Flow
- Learned `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- Practiced `for` loops (iterating over ranges and lists)
- Practiced `while` loops
- Explored `break` and `continue`
- Challenge: My first attempts had syntax mistakes with comparison operators and string formatting inside loops. Fixed by carefully checking the syntax.

## Day 4 – Python Functions
- Learned how to define functions using `def`
- Practiced calling functions with and without parameters
- Used `return` to send values back from functions
- Worked with default parameters
- Challenge: My **first attempt** at building a grade calculator function was wrong — I used `90 - 100 = "A"` instead of proper `if/elif` conditions, and I accidentally made the function call itself. After correction, I understood how to use **ranges and conditions** correctly inside functions.

📝 **Notes to myself:**
- Always test small code snippets in Jupyter before adding more complexity.
- Remember: `elif grade >= 80` not `=>`.
- Print formatting is easier using `f"..."`.
- Don’t call a function **inside itself** unless I’m doing recursion.
- Use `if 90 <= score <= 100:` to check ranges.
