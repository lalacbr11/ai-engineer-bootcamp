# Week 2  

## Topics Covered  
- **Day 1 Recap**: Variables, Data Types, Strings  
- **Day 2**: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets  

## Notes  
- I felt confident with **variables, data types, and strings**.  
- I had **some troubles with tuples and dictionaries**, but I worked through them with exercises and practice.  
- By the end, I was able to create and use all 4 data structures in Python.  

This week gave me a stronger foundation in Python essentials, and Iâ€™m ready to move into **control flow (if/else, loops)** next.
