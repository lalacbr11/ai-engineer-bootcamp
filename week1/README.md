**Focus:** SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, window functions

## Files
- `queries.sql` — solutions to the Week 1 mini-project

## Notes / What I Learned
- JOINs: inner vs. left joins and when to use each  
- GROUP BY with multiple columns and HAVING for filtering aggregates  
- Window functions: ROW_NUMBER vs. RANK  
- Formatting queries improves readability and debugging  

## Next Improvements
- Practice with more complex subqueries  
- Explore CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for cleaner queries
