# 🚀 AI Engineer Bootcamp

Welcome to my **AI Engineer Bootcamp** repository.  
This repo documents my **6-month self-study program** to become an **AI / MLOps & Data Engineering professional**, built alongside my college coursework in Database Programming & Administration.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **week1/** → Python Basics (variables, data types, control flow, functions)  
- **week2/** → Python Essentials (lists, dictionaries, sets, loops, functions)  
- **future weeks/** → SQL, Data Analysis, Statistics, Machine Learning, MLOps, Capstone Project  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.13** (with virtualenv)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive learning  
- **Git/GitHub** for version control  
- **VS Code** as IDE  
- *(coming soon: PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Docker, Airflow, AWS)*  

---

## 📅 Progress

### ✅ Week 1 – Python Basics
- Learned variables, data types, and string operations  
- Practiced control flow: `if` / `elif` / `else`  
- Wrote basic Python functions with parameters and return values  
📓 *See notebooks in `week1/`*  

### ✅ Week 2 – Python Essentials (in progress)
- Working with lists, dictionaries, and sets  
- Practicing loops (`for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`)  
- Exploring function arguments (default, keyword)  
📓 *See notebooks in `week2/`*  

### ⏳ Upcoming
- **Week 3–4:** SQL & Relational Databases (schema design, CRUD, joins)  
- **Week 5–6:** Geospatial Databases (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)  
- **Week 7–8:** Data Ingestion Pipeline (ETL, validation, transformation)  
- **Week 9–10:** Hotspot Modeling (KDE, ML models)  
- **Week 11–12:** API + Visualization (map UI)  

---

## 🚀 Goal

By the end of this bootcamp I will have:  
- A **portfolio of projects** in Python, SQL, MLOps, and AI  
- A **capstone project**: *Abduction Risk Hotspot Prediction*  
   - Build a geospatial database with PostgreSQL + PostGIS  
   - Train models (KDE, XGBoost) for location risk scoring  
   - Deploy results with an API + map UI  
- The skills to start a career in **MLOps & AI Infrastructure**
