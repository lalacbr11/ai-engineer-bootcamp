# AI Engineer Bootcamp

Fast-track, hands-on roadmap to become an AI/ML engineer.  
This repo is my study log and weekly mini-projects.

## ðŸ“… Weekly Plan
- **Week 1 â€” SQL Basics**: schema design, SELECT/JOIN/GROUP BY, window functions â†’ âœ… Done
- **Week 2 â€” Python for Data & ML**: pandas, numpy, plotting
- **Week 3 â€” Git & GitHub Fluency**: branches, PRs, issues, Actions
- **Week 4 â€” Statistics Refresh**: distributions, sampling, hypothesis tests
- **Week 5 â€” ML Fundamentals**: train/test, linear/logistic regression, regularization
- **Week 6 â€” Feature Engineering**: encoding, scaling, leakage, pipelines
- **Week 7 â€” Model Evaluation**: metrics, cross-val, calibration
- **Week 8 â€” Trees & Ensembles**: decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting
- **Week 9 â€” SQL + ML Integration**: data pipelines, notebooksâ†’SQL flows
- **Week 10 â€” Capstone #1**: end-to-end ML project

## âœ… Progress
### Week 1: SQL Basics
- **Artifacts:** `week1/queries.sql` + notes
- **Learnings:**
  - Solidified JOINs and filtering with WHERE/HAVING
  - Learned GROUP BY with aggregates
  - Practiced window functions for rankings
  - Improved query readability with formatting

## ðŸ—‚ Structure
- `week1/` â€” SQL mini-project (queries + notes)
- `plan/` â€” roadmap docs and checklists
- `notebooks/` â€” Python notebooks for data & ML
- `data/` â€” tiny, non-sensitive sample data

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- SQL (SQLite/Postgres)
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Git/GitHub

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Up
- Week 2: Python environment + pandas crash course
- Start exploring first dataset in Jupyter
