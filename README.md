# AI Engineer Bootcamp

This repository documents a 6-month self-study program designed to build
professional competency in AI Engineering, Data Engineering, and MLOps,
developed alongside college coursework in Database Programming & Administration.

## Repository Structure

- **week1/** — Python Basics (variables, data types, control flow, functions)
- **week2/** — Python Essentials (lists, dictionaries, sets, loops, functions)
- **future weeks/** — SQL, Data Analysis, Statistics, Machine Learning, MLOps, Capstone

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.13 (with virtualenv)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git / GitHub
- VS Code
- Planned: PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Docker, Airflow, AWS

- Control flow: if / elif / else
- Functions with parameters and return values

### Week 2 — Python Essentials (complete)
- Lists, dictionaries, and sets
- Loops: for, while, break, continue
- Function arguments: default and keyword

### Upcoming
- Week 3–4: SQL and Relational Databases (schema design, CRUD, joins)
- Week 5–6: Geospatial Databases (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)
- Week 7–8: Data Ingestion Pipeline (ETL, validation, transformation)
- Week 9–10: Risk Scoring and Pattern Analysis
- Week 11–12: API and Visualization layer

## Capstone Project — HT-RAS (Human Trafficking Risk Assessment System)

HT-RAS is a structured, data-driven risk assessment system built on publicly
available, anonymized datasets. It is designed to demonstrate responsible data
engineering, relational database design, aggregated pattern analysis, and
ethical AI thinking — without individual-level inference or automated
decision-making.

**Core components:**
- Relational schema design with PostgreSQL and PostGIS
- Data cleaning and transformation workflows in Python
- Aggregated risk indicator scoring at the geographic level
- Dashboard and API layer for reporting and visualization

Full capstone development resumes post-graduation, May 2026.

## Goal

To build a professional portfolio demonstrating applied skills in Python, SQL,
data engineering, and ethical AI system design — with the capstone project
serving as the centerpiece for roles in AI Engineering, Data Engineering, and
Responsible AI.
