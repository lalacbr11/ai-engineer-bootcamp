# AI Engineer Bootcamp 🚀

Welcome to my **AI Engineer Bootcamp** repository.  
This repo documents my 6-month self-study program to become an **AI/MLOps & Data Engineering professional**, built alongside my college coursework.  

## 📂 Repository Structure


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.13** (with virtualenv)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive learning  
- **Git/GitHub** for version control

## 📅 Progress
- ✅ Day 1: Setup environment, first Python script, Jupyter notebook  
- ⏳ Next: Python essentials, data structures, and Pandas practice  

## 🚀 Goal
By the end of this bootcamp I will have:  
- A portfolio of projects (AI, MLOps, Data Engineering)  
- A final project: **AI system for human trafficking risk prediction (database + ML + infra)**  
- Skills to start a career in **MLOps & AI Infrastructure**
